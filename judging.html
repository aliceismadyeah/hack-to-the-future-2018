<h2>Judging Categories</h2>
<p>Hack to the Future is about thinking beyond Shutterstock Inc. as it exists today. When you brainstorm ideas, pitches and hacks with your team, focus on the future. What does the creative process look like 5 years from now? What tools will your team need 3 years from now to be successful? What does success look like for a storyteller?</p>
<p>
Here are some resources that might spark inspiration for your hacks and pitches:
<a href="http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends">Internet Trends 2015<a> - by Mary Meeker.
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/27/from-social-to-market-networks/">From social networks to market networks</a> - by James Currier on Techcrunch.
<a href="http://platformed.info/marketplaces-stickiness-engagement/">Marketplaces 2.0 article</a> - by Sangeet Choudary.
 </p>
 <p><b>Focus your hack or pitch on one of these three categories:</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Contributor Impact</li>
    <li>Customer Impact</li>
    <li>Employee Value</li>
  </ol>

<p>After the Hack demo's finish at the event on Friday, judges in NYC and San Mateo will meet to select the 3 hack semi-finalists from each location. The Pitches will be reviewed by the pitch judges and 3 will be selected to be shown at the final throwdown on Wednesday, July 22nd.</p>


<h2>Prizes</h2>
<p>Each of the semi-finalists (9 teams) will choose from a selection of subscription services such as Birchbox, Netflix, Amazon and more. 
The winning team will receive tickets to an event of their choice and their hack/pitch will be considered for a sprint in 2015.</p>
