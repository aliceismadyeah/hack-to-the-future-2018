		<p>A hack is quick, cheap, and rarely pretty. But like duct tape, a hack does the job. Sometimes "hack" refers to a piece of code, but it can be any quick solution to a problem. In this spirit, we present Hack to the Future. This is your moment to flex your creativity and pour your energy into making something better.</p>

		<p>We're setting aside a day for your own personal projects, where you can turn your ideas into tangible presentations. The only guideline is that your project must make our company's products or services better. Your idea might be a new site feature, a new marketing campaign, a new incentive for contributors, or a new way to make the company operate more smoothly.</p>

		<p>All employees at any of our offices are invited to participate, and we want you to work in teams. We'll unveil your projects at a special off-site presentation.</p>

		<p>A recommended team size is 4 to 5 people, but you can recruit as many people for your team as you like, and you can be on multiple teams. To be eligible to present and win prizes, your team must include employees from at least 3 departments, and even more are encouraged. For this event, departments are thought of as Tech, Marketing, Product, Content, Sales, and Operations. Check out our <a href="./faq.html">FAQ</a> for more info.</p>

		<p>You can start brainstorming ideas, assembling your team and working on your project as soon as you like. We'd like you to post the names of your team members with an original team name and brief project description to the <a href="./registration.html">Team Registration</a> page.</p>

		<p>We will also be holding information sessions on July 2nd, 8th, and 9th and preparing you through our <a href="./hackademy.html">Hackademy sessions</a> on July 8th, 10th, and 14th!</p>

		<p>If you have further questions, please visit see our <a href="./faq.html">FAQ</a> Page or send an email to <a href="mailto:esams@shutterstock.com?Subject=Hackathon%20Question" target="_blank">Eric Sams</a> or <a href="mailto:jmeng@shutterstock.com?Subject=Hackathon%20Question" target="_blank">Jessica Meng</a>.</p>

		<p>We can't wait to see what you create!</p>
