    <p>Hack to the Future is a two-day ideation event, giving employees the freedom to develop innovative and creative business solutions that address our overall company goals. This year we've modified the format to celebrate our traditions and innovate for the future!</p> 

<p>Teams can participate in Hack to the Future by submitting either a hack or a pitch. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A "hack" refers to a code based project that is a creative solution to a problem. </li>
  <li>A "pitch" refers to a video based mockup or presentation of an idea that is a creative solution to a problem. </li>
</ul>

<p>The overall goal of Hack to the Future is for employees to collaborate and form teams to create innovative solutions focusing on either a Contributor, Customer or Employee benefit. Each team will submit a hack or pitch for one of these users, keeping our mission of empowering the worldâ€™s storytellers in mind.</p> 

<p>This year, there are two centralized demo locations, where employees in satellite offices will team up to hack from their respective offices: </p> 
<p>New York (NYC, Montreal, London, Chicago, Berlin)</p> 
<p>San Mateo (San Fran, San Mateo, LA, Denver, Dallas, APAC).</p> 
<br />
<br />
<p>Hack to the Future is your moment to flex your creativity and pour your energy into making something better.</p>
