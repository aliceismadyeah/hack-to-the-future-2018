</ul>

<p>The overall goal of Hack to the Future is for employees to collaborate and form teams to create innovative solutions focusing on either a Contributor, Customer or Employee benefit. Each team will submit a hack or pitch for one of these users, keeping our mission of empowering the worldâ€™s storytellers in mind.</p>
