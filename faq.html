		<br>

		<p><b>How does my team get to demo?</b><br>
		If your team has people from at least 3 different departments, fill out the <a href="#team-registration">Team Registration</a> form. </p>

		<br>

		<p><b>If I register my team early, will I get to present early during the demo event?</b><br>
		Not necessarily.  Demo presentation order wil be rearranged from team sign up order.</p>

		<br>

		<p><b>What will the demo schedule be like?</b><br>
		Demos begin at 1pm (EST) on Friday, July 18th, at the <a href="./location.hmtl"></a>AMC Empire 25 TheaterWe will have 3 podiums, each with a laptop, from which teams will present.  Each laptop will be connected to the VPN and should be able to access dev and QA environments.  As each team presents, there will be two other teams “on deck” at the other podiums setting up.  . We will have 4 podiums, each with a Macbook Pro laptop, from which teams will present.  Each laptop will be connected to the VPN and should be able to access dev and QA environments.  As each team presents, there will be three other teams “on deck” at the other podiums setting up. Between demos, we'll annouce who's on deck to get ready, so it's important for you to pay attention and listen for your team to be called. </p>

		<br>

		<p><b>Can I present my demo from my own laptop?</b><br>
		NO. You MUST use one of the Macbook Pros we provide at the venue to allow a seamless presentation experience for the audience.</p>

		<br>

		<p><b>How much time will I have to present my Hack?</b><br>
		Each team will have 2 minutes to present their hack project. You are strongly encouraged to practice this presentation.</p>

		<br>

		<p><b>Will there be prizes?</b><br>
		Each hack will be judged during the off-side demos according to the different categories.  Winners of each category will be recognized in some size, shape or form.</p>

		<br>

		<p><b>Do I need to practice my presentation?</b><br>
		YES! We can't stress this enough! Keep in mind that you will have one chance to present to the judges.  The more you practice, the better the presentation will go.</p>

		<br>

		<p><b>Will there be wifi at the demo venue for me to keep hacking?</b><br>
		The laptops for presenters at the podiums will have relatively fast wired connections and will not be connected to wifi.  For everyone else, we will have a shared wifi network at the venue but it probably not be very fast due to the number of people using it.  If it looks like wifi is using too much of the bandwidth that presentations get slow, we will have to turn the wifi off.</p>

		<br>

		<p><b>How will I know when my 2 minutes are up?</b><br>
		Unless you are showing a video, in which case you get 3 minutes total to introduce and play your video.  During your team’s presentation, look for the iPad with a timer to see how much time you have left to present.  (When there are 30 seconds left, the digits will turn yellow; when there are 10 seconds left, the digits will turn red.  If you go overtime, the background will turn red.)</p>

		<br>

		<p><b>Can I show a video at hackathon?</b><br>
		Yes! In the past we've had teams make funny videos of new features they'd like to see implemented on the site. We've also had remote teams make videos so that they wouldnt have to worry about logistics and bandwidth of doing a presentation.  If you are showing a video during your demo, we highly recommend you bring it on a thumb drive or other storage medium rather than trying to stream it over the network. Also, the projector at the movie theater is 4K capable so the higher the resolution of your video the better, but a video at 1080p is fine. All presentation laptops will be Macbook Pros, so please bring a video format compatible to that device. When presenting, make sure to full screen your video on the presentation laptop to provide the best viewing experience for the audience. Don't leave the video playback controls on the screen when it is playing, so please move the mouse pointer away from the controls in QuickTime player and they will disappear after a few seconds.</p>
