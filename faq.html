     <h1>FAQ</h1>


		<h3>Logistics</h3>

		<p><b>Does this run all night?</b><br>
		Hack to the Future runs 24 hours from noon to noon. The office is open all night, and you can sleep if you want!  Project demo presentations will then take place during the afternoon of Friday, July 18th.</p>

		No, but we strongly encourage everyone to participate.</p>
		<br>

		<p><b>What if my regular job duties prevent me from participating?</b><br>
		Please talk to your manager to see if together you can make it work.  You may participate for just part of the day if that works better.</p>
