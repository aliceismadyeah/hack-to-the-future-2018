     <h1>FAQ</h1>

<h3>Logistics</h3>
<p><b>Does this run all night?</b><br />
Hack to the Future runs 24 hours from noon to noon. The office is open all night, and you can sleep if you want! Project demo presentations will then take place during the afternoon of Friday, July 17th.
</p>

<p><b>Do we have to work through the entire 24 hour period?</b><br />
	No, you can work on your project as much as you want.
</p>



<p><b>Will you provide snacks and refreshments?</b><br />
Yes! We'll be serving lunch, dinner, breakfast, and snacks during the 24 hour event.	
</p>



<p><b>Is it mandatory?</b><br />
	No, but we strongly encourage everyone to participate.
</p>



<p><b>What if my regular job duties prevent me from participating?</b><br />
Please talk to your manager to see if together you can make it work. You may participate for just part of the day if that works better.	
</p>



<p><b>Does my project have to "work?"</b><br />
No, you can have your project as realized as you want it to be, from an initial pitch to a fully working prototype.	
</p>





<h3>Projects & Teams</h3>
<p><b>How will the company use my project or idea?</b><br />
	The projects will be showcased on this site post-event. The winning hacks and pitches will be considered for the product roadmap. If the hacks or pitches are deemed feasible, the company will set a goal of implementing them by the end of 2015. 

</p>



<p><b>What are some examples of projects?</b><br />
	
New site features and tools for contributors or customers. New marketing and advertising strategies. Internal tools for Shutterstock employee benefit. A sales call-a-thon.
</p>


<p><b>Does my project have to be technical or related to Shutterstock?</b><br />
Your project can be a hack (code based project) or a pitch (video based mock-up or presentation) that thinks beyond Shutterstock Inc. as it exists today. Your hack or pitch should fall into one of three categories: 1. contributor impact 2. customer impact or 3. employee value.
</p>



<p><b>What if there are no programmers on my team?</b><br />
	You don't need programmers or code to create a pitch video! Click on the hackademy tab to learn how to storyboard your idea, build interactive mockups that look great and present your idea clearly.

</p>


<p><b>How will I know if my idea has been hacked together already?</b><br />

</p>



<p><b>Are Shutterstock logos, buttons, and other design assets available for me to use in my project?</b><br />
Yes! You can get design assets by going to <a href="http://designs.shuttercorp.net/keystone/hackathon-2014-shutterstock-assets/">this page</a> (works from inside the office or on the VPN).	
</p>



<h3>Demo Presentations & Prizes</h3>

<p><b>What teams will be eligible to present and to win prizes?</b><br />
Only hack teams with at least 4 different departments and pitch teams with at least 3 different departments are eligible to demo and win prizes. Solo hackers and teams with members from fewer departments are still welcome to hack.

</p>


<p><b>What are the different departments at Shutterstock?</b><br />

For this year, departments are defined as:
Tech (Developers, Engineers, Tech Ops, QA, BI, IT.)
Marketing (Regional Directors, Marketing Design, Blog, PR, ECRM, Events.)
Product (Product Managers, UX Designers, Researchers, GMs.)
Content (Acquisition, Reviewers, Researchers, Editors, Contributor Support.)
Sales & Customer Service (AE's / AM's / SAE's.)
Operations (Finance / Legal / HR / Biz Dev.)
</p>


<p><b>How does my team get to demo?</b><br />
All teams must complete the <a href="/registration.html">Team Registration form</a> by 9:00am on Friday, July 17th to be able to demo. 
</p>



<p><b>If I register my team early, will I get to present early during the demo event?</b><br />
Not necessarily. Demo presentation order will be re-arranged per category
</p>


<p><b>What will the demo schedule be like?</b><br />
Demos begin at 1pm (EST) on Friday, July 17th, at the AMC Empire 25 Theater. 
We will have 3 podiums, each with a laptop, where each team will present. Each laptop will be connected to the VPN and should be able to access dev and QA environments. As each team presents, there will be two other teams “on deck” at the other podiums setting up. Between demos, we'll announce who's on deck to get ready, so it's important for you to pay attention and listen for your team to be called.

</p>

<p><b>Can I present my demo from my own laptop?</b><br />
NO. You MUST use one of the Macbook Pros we provide at the venue to allow a seamless presentation experience for the audience.

</p>


<p><b>How much time will I have to present my Hack?</b><br />
Each team will have 2 minutes to present their hack project. You are strongly encouraged to practice this presentation.

</p>

<p><b>Will there be prizes?</b><br />
Each hack will be judged during the off-side demos according to the different categories. Winners of each category will be recognized in some size, shape or form.

</p>

<p><b>Do I need to practice my presentation?</b><br />
YES! We can't stress this enough! Keep in mind that you will have one chance to present to the judges. The more you practice, the better the presentation will go.

</p>

<p><b>Will there be wifi at the demo venue for me to keep hacking?</b><br />
The laptops for presenters at the podiums will have relatively fast wired connections and will not be connected to wifi. For everyone else, we will have a shared wifi network at the venue but it probably not be very fast due to the number of people using it. If it looks like wifi is using too much of the bandwidth that presentations get slow, we will have to turn the wifi off.

</p>

<p><b>How will I know when my 2 minutes are up?</b><br />
During your team’s presentation, look for a person holding an iPad in the front row. This will have a countdown timer. When there are 30 seconds left, the digits will turn yellow; when there are 10 seconds left, the digits will turn red. When your time is up, Niamh will ring the gong.

</p>

<p><b>Can I show a video at hackathon?</b><br />
If your team is submitting a pitch video, this will not be shown at the Hack to the Future semi-finals on Friday, July 17th. All pitch videos will be reviewed by the pitch judging team in a private review session and the pitches selected for the final throwdown will be shown on Wednesday, July 22nd.
<br /><br />
If there are funny entertainment videos submitted, these will be shown at the Hack to the Future semi-finals on Friday, July 17th during the breaks.
<br /><br />
If you have a video of your hack that you'd like to present during the demo, we recommend you bring it on a thumb drive or other storage medium rather than trying to stream it over the network. Also, the projector at the movie theater is 4K capable so the higher the resolution of your video the better, but a video at 1080p is fine. All presentation laptops will be Macbook Pros, so please bring a video format compatible to that device. When presenting, make sure to full screen your video on the presentation laptop to provide the best viewing experience for the audience. Don't leave the video playback controls on the screen when it is playing, so please move the mouse pointer away from the controls in QuickTime player and they will disappear after a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
<b>I am remote, how do I demo?<b><br /> 
If you are remote, and you don't have a team member at the demo event we will have you demo your hack via google hangout.
